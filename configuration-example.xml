	This is XML, if you don't know XML, look it up.
	It's really easy, if you can host a RoR-server, host this bot,
	then I assume that you can read/write XML as well.
	
	There're 2 sections in this file:
	  - The Discord configuration
	  - The RoR-server(s) configuration
	Quite self-explanatory.
	
	Minimal configuration:
		<configuration>
			<Discordclient>
				<bot token="" />
			</Discordclient>
			<RoRclients>
				<RoRclient>
					<server host="yourHost" port=somePort />
					<discord channel="" />
				</RoRclient>
			</RoRclients>
		</configuration>
 -->
<configuration>

	<Discordclient>
		<bot token="" />
	</Discordclient>
	
	<RoRclients>
		<RoRclient id="myServer1" enabled="yes">
			<server host="example.com" port="12000" password="" />
			<user name="Services" token="515cf64ec28c445ca5786ec7122d7154" language="en_US" />
			<!-- Copy and paste the channel ID here. To get the channel ID you must first enter 
			Developer Mode from User Settings -> Appearance -> Advanced -> and toggle on/off
			for Developer Mode -->
			<discord channel="" />
			<announcements delay="600" enabled="yes"> <!-- delay in seconds -->
				<announcement>Hi, I'm an announcement</announcement>
				<announcement>And I'm the second announcement.</announcement>
				<announcement>And I'm the last one. After me, you'll see number 1 again</announcement>
			</announcements>
		</RoRclient>
	</RoRclients>

</configuration>
